    "introduction": "The Laser Optics Virtual Lab offers an immersive, simulation-based platform to explore foundational and advanced concepts in laser physics and optical interferometry. Designed for both undergraduate and postgraduate learners, this virtual lab facilitates conceptual understanding and experimental skills in a safe, interactive, and accessible environment. The experiments employ laser-based techniques to analyze optical phenomena such as interference, diffraction, polarization, and light propagation in various media. The lab also explores applications such as refractive index measurement, beam profiling, and fiber optics, supporting interdisciplinary learning in physics, engineering, and optical communication.",
